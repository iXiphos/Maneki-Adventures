# ManekiAdventures

The intent of Maneki Adventure is to create a single-player, 3D “puzzle”-exploration game focused on the simple yet whimsical appeal of a charming, cute, cozy, and childlike tone with an emphasis on ingredient collecting and potion crafting

It is a potion-crafting puzzle game with a cute and cozy basis in discovery, friendship, love, and a focus on exploration.

The gameplay is slow and cozy with an emphasis on exploration and the creative use of potions to solve puzzles.
