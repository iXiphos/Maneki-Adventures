// Kiki picks up the increase or the decrease ingredient for the first time

Ru: Oh, it’s that flower! Good idea!

Kiki: What idea?

Ru: That’s a potion ingredient silly! The pink ones like this make an increasing potion, and the yellow ones make a decreasing potion.

Kiki: I picked this for you!

Ru: Aww, that’s so sweet. But, er, you picked me a potion ingredient. The pink ones like this make an **increasing potion**, and the yellow ones make a **decreasing** potion.
Ru: Wait, you don’t know this? Maneki, have you been studying at all?

Kiki: Well…

Ru: ...It’s fine, it’s fine. You got this. I’m not worried at all...

Kiki: C’mon, have some faith in me!

Ru: I-I do! Absolutely! I’m not worried at all...
