Dear Player,

Welcome to Maneki Adventure! We are so excited for you to play our demo. This is a vertical slice of our game
that includes a working example of every aspect of our game. Throughout the demo, you will encounter challenges 
and puzzles that will test your wit and creativity, but lucky for you, you have some magic up your sleeve! 
Craft and throw potions to affect the size, weight, and friction of objects in the world. After completing 
the puzzles, you will be rewarded with an open sandbox where you can experiment and play with the potions. Have fun! 
A piece of a magical world awaits you!

Yours Truly,
Team Ruby Studio
